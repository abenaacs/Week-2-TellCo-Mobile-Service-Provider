This folder contains Python scripts for production tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and visualization. These scripts are modular, reusable, and integrated with testing and CI/CD pipelines.

## Contents

1. **`data_cleaning.py`**
   - Handles missing values, outlier treatment, and basic data preprocessing.
2. **`feature_engineering.py`**
   - Implements feature transformations, segmentation, and variable engineering.
3. **`eda.py`**
   - Aggregates user metrics and calculates descriptive statistics.
4. **`visualizations.py`**
   - Creates visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and PCA graphs.

## Usage

Run each script individually:

```bash
python data_cleaning.py
python feature_engineering.py
```
